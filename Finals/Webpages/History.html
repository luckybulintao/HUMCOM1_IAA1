                Ifugao was formerly known as a part of the old Mountain Province. It was created as an independent province 
                    on June 18, 1966 by virtue of Republic Act No. 4695, otherwise known as the Division Law of Mountain
                     Province. Under this Law, Mountain Province was divided into four provinces namely: Benguet, Ifugao,
                      Kalinga Apayao, and Mountain Province. The word "Ifugao" means hill. The Spaniards changed 'pugo' to
                       'pugaw' and was finally changed by the Americans to "Ifugao". The province of Ifugao is a land-locked
                        area located at the foot of the Cordillera mountain ranges. It is bounded by the high peaked mountain
                        of Benguet in the western side, Nueva Vizcaya on the southern side, Isabela on the eastern side, and 
                        on the north by the protruding strip of the territory of Mountain Province. It is generally located at
                         120 degrees 40'17" longitude.</center>

                In the Northern Philippines, the Ifugao people are one of many minority ethnolinguistic groups best documented by
                ethnohistoric and anthropological scholars. However, there is a dearth of historical information in the region
                 particularly during the Spanish conquest. Changes in both demographics and cultural orientation among existing 
                 communities were to be expected during the time as certain groups resulted to migration towards the highlands.
                  According to studies, the Ifugao succeeded multiple times resisting against the Spanish at conquest. 
                  The groups that migrated to the highlands were believed to be those that resisted the Spanish colonial 
                  control, which became prevalent in the lowlands. According to Acabado, the rugged nature of the highlands
                   around the Ifugao region did not out rightly provide a hindrance to the Spanish conquest. Other regions 
                   that had similar rugged environment as found in Ifugao were subjected to colonial rule. Archeological 
                   research shows Ifugao practices of successful resistance by strengthening their political and economic resources. 
                Spanish conquest and population increase was the source of shifting to wet-rice agriculture.</center>
