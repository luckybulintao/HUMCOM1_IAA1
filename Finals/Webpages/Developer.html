               Hello world! My name is Lucky Bulintao from Lagawe, Ifugao. I am a 19 years old Computer Science student studying in the University 
               of Baguio. My inspiration in creating this website is my home province, I want to showcase my home province to other people but
               the main reason I created this website was because my teacher instructed us to create a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
               Moving on, I want to work with technology in the future. Overall, this is my final ouput for my HUMCOM1 subject and I hope you have
               a good day.
