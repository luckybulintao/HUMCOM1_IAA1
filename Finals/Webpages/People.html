                    The Ifugao people are the ethnic group inhabiting Ifugao Province. They reside in the municipalities of Lagawe (Capital Town), Aguinaldo, Alfonso Lista, Asipulo, Banaue, Hingyon, Hungduan, Kiangan, Lamut, Mayoyao, and Tinoc. The province is one of the smallest provinces in the Philippines with an area of only 251,778 hectares, or about 0.8% of the total Philippine land area. As of 1995, the population of the Ifugaos was counted to be 131,635. Although the majority of them are still in Ifugao province, some of them have moved to Baguio, where they work as woodcarvers, and to other parts of the Cordillera Region.

                    Ifugao, is group of wet-rice agriculturalists but other people started to pursue other professions rather than farming so a decline in the number of wet-rice agriculturalistsis declining. Right now, the majority of the adult Ifugao people are professionals in their own professions. Ifugao people occupy the mountainous area of northern Luzon, Philippines. They are of Malay stock and their language is Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian), as is that of their neighbours, but they have developed a number of cultural characteristics that set them apart. They numbered nearly 70,000 in 1939, but World War II reduced their population to a figure (1948) of 50,000. By the late 20th century, their population had increased to about 190,000.

                    In the present time, the people from Ifugao have adapted to the modern world compared to the early 1900's where people mostly pursue farming. It was in the mid 1900's when more and more people started to go to school and that is when the people of Ifugao started to adapt to the changing world.
                    <br><br>
                    There are still a lot of Ifugao people who does farming for a living because it still gives a good profit and enough money to make their kids finish their studies.
                    <br>
                    For their community, there are municipalities where urbanization is at a faster growth rate than the others.

                    There are also some municipalities where the mountainous areas remains the same but there are people who still lives in that area.

                    The Ifugao language consists of four dialects. Due to being isolated by the terrain, Ifugaos usually speak in Ilocano, Tagalog, and English as their alternative to their mother tongue.<br>

                    Overall, the Ifugao people have adapted to the modern world but still keeps their cultures and traditions alive.
