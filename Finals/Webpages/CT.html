                Ifugao culture values kinship, family ties, religious and cultural beliefs. Ifugao are unique among all 
                ethnic groups in the mountain province for their narrative literature such as the hudhud, an epic dealing
                 with hero ancestors sung in a poetic manner. Also unique to the Ifugao is their woodcarving art, most notably
                  the carved granary guardians bulul and the prestige bench of the upper class, the hagabi. Their textiles 
                  are renowned for their sheer beauty, colorful blankets and clothing woven on looms. The Ifuago are known
                   for their rich oral literary traditions of hudhud and the alim. In 2001, the Hudhud Chants of the Ifugao was
                    chosen as one of the 11 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It was then formally 
                    inscribed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008. The Ifugaosâ€™ highest prestige feasts are the hagabi,
                     sponsored by the elite (kadangyan); and the uyauy, a marriage feast sponsored by those immediately below
                     the wealthiest (inmuy-ya-uy). Ifugao heirloom beads are prestigious goods that were limited to the Ifugao
                      community of wealth; moreover, such beads were solely utilized for ritualistic occasions such as: funerals,
                       weddings, and rice harvest festivals and signified respect. Rice granaries (alang) are protected by a wooden
                        guardian called a bulul. The bulul sculptures are highly stylized representations of the ancestors of the Ifugao
                         and are thought to gain power and wealth from the presence of the ancestral spirit. The Ifugao are particularly
                          noted for their skill in carving bulul. Furthermore, Ifugao culture is known for their legal system,
                           based on the elders of the village, amama-a. Their words had the effect of law, without appeal. The jury, agom,
                            consisted of those articulate, mansapit, elders. If the jury could not decide a case, trial by ordeal was invoked.
                             The logic being that the gods and goddesses, Kabunian, would not allow the innocent to suffer.
                              Criminal cases are tried by ordeal. They include duels (uggub/alao), wrestling (bultong), hot bolo ordeal 
                              and boiling water ordeal (da-u). Bultong is the name for the Ifugao sport of traditional wrestling. 
                              It is often played during town and provincial fiestas. Bultong falls under the international 
                              classification of "belt wrestling".
