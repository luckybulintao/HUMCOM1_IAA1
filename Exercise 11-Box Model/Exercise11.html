        <p><h3><mark>Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as 
            disadvantaged,and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads 
            anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron 
            as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp
            boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person
            Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save
            his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).</mark><h3>

            <p><h3><mark>Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. 
                It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of
                 becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in
                  Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga 
                  by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).</mark></h3>

            <p> <h3><mark>Adventure Time[c] is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton Ward 
                for Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn (Jeremy Shada) 
                and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio)—a dog with the magical power
                to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, 
                where they interact with Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny), 
                Marceline (Olivia Olson), BMO (Niki Yang), and others.The series is based on a 2007 short film
                 that aired on Nicktoons. After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Nickelodeon's 
                 executives passed on its option before Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series from
                  Seibert and Ward, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show premiered on Cartoon Network on
                   April 5, 2010, and ended on September 3, 2018.</mark></h3></p>
