        <article style="color: aliceblue;"><p style="font-family: Tahoma;">Tarantulas are arachnids related to spiders but tarantulas grow much 
            larger and can weigh up to 1 to 3 ounces. Tarantulas could live up to 30 years depending in the species and its environment, they can also reach a legspan of 11 inches
             depending on the species. Tarantulas are carnivores and also insectivores which preys on insects, birds, snakes, and other 
             arachnids. The scientific name of a tarantulas is <i>"Theraposidae"</i>. There are two kinds of tarantulas which are old world and new world tarantulas.
            Old world tarantulas are from the eastern hemisphere and they more aggresive and prone to biting. New world tarantulas came from the western
            hemisphere and they are more docile compared to old world tarantulas and are equiped with urticating hairs.</p>

        <article><p style="font-family: Tahoma;">There are many species of tarantulas which where discovered first in the year 1800's. These discoveries
            continued to grow as zoologist and scientist continue to discover more and more tarantula species and genus. As years
            went by, these discoveries have continued to grow. In the present time, there are about 850 or more species that have already
            been identified and discovered. These discoveries are made thanks to some of our zoologist and scientist who dedicated their lives
            in studying tarantulas. Some of the known people who discovered tarantula species are Pocock, Simon, Ausserer, and many other people.
